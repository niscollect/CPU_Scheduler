#  Scheduler Simulator — A Time-Driven OS Lab in Code

A simple but insightful **CPU Scheduler Simulator** built in C that mimics how an Operating System manages CPU time among multiple processes. It supports multiple scheduling algorithms like **FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve)** and **SJF (Shortest Job First)** in a **tick-by-tick simulation model**.

> This isn't a full OS kernel. It's a **learning-driven simulation** where each tick represents a CPU time unit, and every state transition is logged for clarity.

---

##  Features

-  Tick-by-tick simulation (1 tick = 1 CPU time unit)
-  Multiple Scheduling Algorithms: FCFS, SJF (non-preemptive)
-  Modular code structure (clean separation of scheduling logic)
-  Command-line algorithm selection
-  Handles CPU idle time and I/O-aware jobs (future-ready)
-  Metrics tracking: Turnaround Time, Waiting Time, Response Time (WIP)
-  Designed for easy extension to RR, SRTF, MLFQ, etc.

---

##  Simulation Model

At each tick:
- Tracks which process is **running**
- Which are **waiting** in the ready queue
- Which are **doing I/O** (extension planned)
- How they **move between states**

It’s like a time-driven OS lab session – but in C code.

##  Input Format

Each process has:
- `pid`: Process ID (string)
- `arrival_time`: When it arrives in the system
- `CPU burst(s)`: A sequence of CPU time requirements (e.g., `4,5,6`)
- `I/O burst(s)`: (Optional) Time spent doing I/O in between CPU bursts (e.g., `2,3`)

**Note:** Initial version only supports single burst (no I/O interleaving yet).
